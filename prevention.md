### kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment:

**Sexual harassment happens when someone behaves in a way that makes another person uncomfortable, upset, or unsafe because of unwanted attention of a sexual nature. Here are examples in simple terms:**

### In case I face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour:

 1. **Speak Up:**

    Firmly tell the harasser to stop their behavior if you feel safe doing so. Use clear language like, "This behavior is not acceptable."

2. **File a Complaint:**
